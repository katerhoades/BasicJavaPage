# How to add your p5 Javascript to a webpage

1. Make a new file in your github repository titled sketch.js

2. Paste your p5 code into this page and commit changes

3. Go to an HTML file in your repository (remember, this has to be either a page connected to the [portfolio site](https://github.com/katerhoades/GithubSetup/blob/master/README.md) you made, or a page that has been published with [github pages](https://github.com/katerhoades/NetartSetup)) where you would like your p5 sketch to appear and paste this code:

          <html>
          <head>
          <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/p5.js/0.6.0/p5.js"></script>
          <script src="sketch.js"></script>
          </head>
          <body>
          </body>
          </html>

4. The update might take a little while to load, but you should soon be able to see it when yo go to the HTML page from step 3!
